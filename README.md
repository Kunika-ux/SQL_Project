**Project Description:**
The Pizza Sales Analysis project leverages SQL queries to extract valuable insights from pizza sales data, enabling better decision-making for business growth. This project focuses on analyzing sales performance, order trends, and customer preferences. It includes basic and intermediate SQL queries to retrieve key sales metrics, identify best-selling products, and track order distribution patterns.
By working with relational database tables such as Orders, Order Details, Pizza Types, and Pizza Categories, the project demonstrates SQL capabilities like aggregations, joins, filtering, and grouping to generate meaningful reports.

**Project Objectives & Key Insights**
_Basic SQL Analysis:_
1️⃣ Retrieve the total number of orders placed – Understand overall business demand.
2️⃣ Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales – Measure financial performance.
3️⃣ Identify the highest-priced pizza – Determine premium product offerings.
4️⃣ Identify the most common pizza size ordered – Optimize inventory and packaging.
5️⃣ List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities – Identify customer favorites.

_Intermediate SQL Analysis:_
6️⃣ Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered – Understand which category (Veg, Non-Veg, Specialty) is most popular.
7️⃣ Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day – Identify peak ordering times for better staffing and operations.
8️⃣ Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas – Analyze which categories contribute most to sales.
9️⃣ Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day – Track sales trends over time.
🔟 Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue – Identify the most profitable pizza types.

**_SQL Techniques Used:_**
✔ Aggregations – SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN().
✔ Joins – INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.
✔ Filtering & Grouping – GROUP BY,ORDER BY.
✔ Date & Time Functions – Extracting and analyzing sales trends by date and time.
✔ Subqueries & CTEs – For complex data retrieval.

**Database Schema (Sample Tables Used)**
1️⃣ Orders Table – Stores order details with timestamps.
2️⃣ Order Details Table – Contains order-wise pizza quantities and prices.
3️⃣ Pizza Types Table – Lists different pizza names and their attributes.
4️⃣ Pizza Categories Table – Defines pizza classifications (Veg, Non-Veg, Specialty).
